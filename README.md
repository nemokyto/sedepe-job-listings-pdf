# sedepe-job-listings-pdf
A Python automation solution for generating polished PDF reports from Sedepe job listings.

This listing of jobs ISN'T private data. The .csv is generated on the Ministry website. Everything my csv_reader does will be displayed daily at https://www.sedepe.pe.gov.br for the public, using the same data.
